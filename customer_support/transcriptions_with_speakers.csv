Speaker 00 (Agent),Thank you for calling Nissan. My name is Lauren. Can I have your name?
Speaker 01 (Customer),"Yeah, my name is John Smith."
Speaker 00 (Agent),"Thank you, John. How can I help you?"
Speaker 01 (Customer),I was just calling about to see how much it would cost to update the map in my car.
Speaker 00 (Agent),I'd be happy to help you with that today. Did you receive a mailer from us?
Speaker 01 (Customer),I did. Do you need the customer number?
Speaker 00 (Agent),"Yes, please."
Speaker 01 (Customer),"Okay, it's 15243."
Speaker 00 (Agent),"Thank you, and the year-making model of your vehicle?"
Speaker 01 (Customer),"Yeah, I have a 2009 Nissan Altima."
Speaker 00 (Agent),"Oh, nice car."
Speaker 01 (Customer),"Yeah, thank you. We really enjoy it."
Speaker 00 (Agent),"Okay, I think I found your profile here. Can I have you verify your address and phone number, please?"
Speaker 01 (Customer),"Yes, it's 1255 North Research Way. That's in Orem, Utah, 84097. And my phone number is 01431-1000."

Speaker 00 (Agent),The price of the new map is $99 plus shipping and tax. Let me go ahead and set up this order for you.
Speaker 01 (Customer),"Well, can we wait just a second? I'm not really sure if I can afford it right now."
Speaker 00 (Agent),"All right, well, here are a few reasons to consider purchasing today. It looks as though you haven't updated your vehicle for three years."
Speaker 00 (Agent),So that would be the equivalent of getting three years worth of updates for the price of one.
Speaker 01 (Customer),"Oh, okay."
Speaker 00 (Agent),"In addition, special offers like the current promotion don't come around too often."
Speaker 00 (Agent),I would definitely recommend taking advantage of the extra $50 off before it expires.
Speaker 01 (Customer),"Yeah, that does sound pretty good."
Speaker 00 (Agent),"If I set this order up for you now, it'll ship out today and for $50 less. Do you have your credit card handy and I can place this order for you now?"
Speaker 01 (Customer),"Yeah, let's go ahead and use a visa. My number is..."
