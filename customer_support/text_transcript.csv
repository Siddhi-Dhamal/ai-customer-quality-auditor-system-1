SPEAKER_00,Hi!,0,1
SPEAKER_01,What is your favorite holiday?,1,2
SPEAKER_00,one where I get to meet lots of different people.,2,3
SPEAKER_01,What was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday?,3,4
SPEAKER_00,Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.,4,5
SPEAKER_01,Which holiday was that?,5,6
SPEAKER_00,I think it was Australia,6,7
SPEAKER_01,Do you still talk to the people you met?,7,8
SPEAKER_00,Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them,8,9
SPEAKER_01,"Yea, me too. I feel like God often puts strangers in front of you, and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways. Do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you?",9,10
SPEAKER_00,what do you mean?,10,11
SPEAKER_01,"I think it's like a 6th sense, often seen as ""cold readings"" to people, but can be remarkably accurate. I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain. It turns out that he did in the exact spot, and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party. I had never met the man before and never saw him again.",11,12
SPEAKER_00,"Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky",12,13
SPEAKER_01,"There's this practice called ""Treasure Hunting"" that's kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There's a book called ""The Ultimate Treasure Hunt"" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love.",13,14
SPEAKER_00,"So, do you do treasure hunting often?",14,15
SPEAKER_01,"I did more when I was in grad school (and had more time). I would usually go with friends. For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger. Usually, they are vague hope-filled messages, but it's weird when I blurt out something oddly specific.",15,16
SPEAKER_00,Hi,16,17
SPEAKER_01,Any plans for the weekend?,17,18
SPEAKER_00,my friends are gonna visit me this weekend. we might go hiking!,18,19
SPEAKER_01,That's great! How's the weather over the weekend? I hope its warm.,19,20
SPEAKER_00,Should be very sunny! you?,20,21
SPEAKER_01,Cool! very depressing plans ... stay home and work 😞 I have a project deadline very close.,21,22
SPEAKER_00,😐 hope you get your work done very soon! a bug free weekend!,22,23
SPEAKER_01,"Right, very anxious! where do you plan to go for a hike?",23,24
SPEAKER_00,I am going to Diablo!,24,25
SPEAKER_01,"Nice, where is that place? I haven't been there",25,26
SPEAKER_00,hours drive from here. still in bay area,26,27
SPEAKER_01,That's cool! How long is the hike?,27,28
SPEAKER_00,"Actually no idea, but it will take the entire day for that.",28,29
SPEAKER_01,nice! sounds fun!,29,30
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,30,31
SPEAKER_01,Hey there! What's up???,31,32
SPEAKER_00,"Nothing much, how you doin?",32,33
SPEAKER_01,I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D,33,34
SPEAKER_00,Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?,34,35
SPEAKER_01,"The last time in New York, back in June.",35,36
SPEAKER_00,Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward...,36,37
SPEAKER_01,"Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently",37,38
SPEAKER_00,Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?,38,39
SPEAKER_01,Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?,39,40
SPEAKER_00,"Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!",40,41
SPEAKER_01,What kinds of adventures?? Any ones that I would be able to join you on?,41,42
SPEAKER_00,Hmmmm. I really want to try bull riding. Do you have any interest in that?,42,43
SPEAKER_01,I'd love to try! Can we schedule something for next week?,43,44
SPEAKER_00,Sure! What does your Saturday look like?,44,45
SPEAKER_01,"Saturday looks pretty good, shall we shoot for something in the morning?",45,46
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,46,47
SPEAKER_01,hey,47,48
SPEAKER_00,is it raining pretty bad today?,48,49
SPEAKER_01,"yeah, can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options",49,50
SPEAKER_00,surprising that the rain started early this year... I don't like them too much. They make days gloomy,50,51
SPEAKER_01,"yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here 😛",51,52
SPEAKER_00,"Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...",52,53
SPEAKER_01,"yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down",53,54
SPEAKER_00,Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms,54,55
SPEAKER_01,yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here,55,56
SPEAKER_00,people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area,56,57
SPEAKER_01,"it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire",57,58
SPEAKER_00,hmm.... okay. Climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting. did you see it?,58,59
SPEAKER_01,"nope, what does it say?",59,60
SPEAKER_00,they were talking about how AI is helping climate change. Nice use of upcoming tech.,60,61
SPEAKER_00,Hi.,61,62
SPEAKER_01,Helloooooo!,62,63
SPEAKER_00,How are you? How is your day?,63,64
SPEAKER_01,"Good. Don't have much to do today, feels good. How are you?",64,65
SPEAKER_00,I'm dressed very wel today so I feel good! I've been reading a lot about the psychology of positive outlook.,65,66
SPEAKER_01,So what's your outlook? Something blue?,66,67
SPEAKER_00,Yes. Blue is a tranquil colour. It's a good metaphor. Do you have good advice for positivity?,67,68
SPEAKER_01,"You should drink more water, do some push up, and sleep early.",68,69
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,69,70
SPEAKER_01,"Hey, how are you?",70,71
SPEAKER_00,I'm a bit sad. I miss my cat.,71,72
SPEAKER_01,Oh no… Have you sent out the missing cat posters? Hope your cat is alright!,72,73
SPEAKER_00,"Posters is a great idea. So far I've just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name. Anyway, how is your day going so far?",73,74
SPEAKER_01,"Yea, I know they love the plastic bag sound all the time. I am good, nothing special though.",74,75
SPEAKER_00,"If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?",75,76
SPEAKER_01,"I like rainforest, but I know it requires extensive training beforehand.",76,77
SPEAKER_00,I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.,77,78
SPEAKER_01,I am afraid I will be scared of doing this :),78,79
SPEAKER_00,"I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it.",79,80
SPEAKER_01,I don't know if there is any medication for acrophobia. I want to take plenty of it if I really have to do it.,80,81
SPEAKER_00,"If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions",81,82
SPEAKER_01,That's a great idea! Maybe alcohol is such a thing.,82,83
SPEAKER_00,"Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!",83,84
SPEAKER_01,Oops. I won't do it again. Ha,84,85
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,85,86
SPEAKER_01,Hey sup,86,87
SPEAKER_00,not much. any plans this weekend?,87,88
SPEAKER_01,I'm going to try that thing where you hang from a wire as you go down. do you know what is it called?,88,89
SPEAKER_00,ziplining?,89,90
SPEAKER_01,that's the one! have you ever tried it?,90,91
SPEAKER_00,i have a couple years ago. it's quite a unique experience,91,92
SPEAKER_01,where did you do it?,92,93
SPEAKER_00,"i forgot where it was, it wasn't local i don't think though",93,94
SPEAKER_01,no worries. what's the most exciting thing you ever done?,94,95
SPEAKER_00,that's a hard question and i'm tired so i'm going to go. see you,95,96

SPEAKER_00,Hi!,103,104
SPEAKER_01,"Hello, have you seen any good movies lately?",104,105
SPEAKER_00,"I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?",105,106
SPEAKER_01,"I have never seen Avatar, what is it about? I really enjoy the Avenger movies",106,107
SPEAKER_00,"it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature",107,108
SPEAKER_01,That sounds really cool! I think that movie did really well when it was in the box office so it must be good!,108,109
SPEAKER_00,yea. what else do you like to do beside movies?,109,110
SPEAKER_01,I enjoy baking cookies. I am on a quest to bake the best chocolate chip cookie 🙂 What about you?,110,111
SPEAKER_00,I enjoy eating 🙂,111,112
SPEAKER_01,so definitely would like to try your best chocolate cookie,112,113
SPEAKER_00,I will have to bake some soon and let you know. What types of food do you like to eat?,113,114
SPEAKER_01,thanks! I generally love noodle soups like Pho or Ramen :),114,115
SPEAKER_00,Noodle soup is delicious! Do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out?,115,116
SPEAKER_01,I prefer to go out. I'm not a good cook haha,116,117
SPEAKER_00,"Same! Even though I bake, I cannot cook",117,118
SPEAKER_01,"seems like we share a thing in common, yay!",118,119
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,119,120
SPEAKER_01,Good afternoon!,120,121
SPEAKER_00,How has your week been?,121,122
SPEAKER_01,So far so good. It is holiday season. So just chilling,122,123
SPEAKER_00,I think I'm getting sick with a cold 😞 So you should chill on my behalf too cause I'm out the game for all of December.,123,124
SPEAKER_01,lol Sorry to hear that. Are you planning anything fun for December?,124,125
SPEAKER_00,Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick.,125,126
SPEAKER_01,😂,126,127
SPEAKER_00,Do you have big plans?,127,128
SPEAKER_01,Yes! I am going to Hawaii! This will be my first time visiting Hawaii. Really excited about it.,128,129
SPEAKER_00,I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion.,129,130
SPEAKER_01,lol this is the first time I heard from a boy who cares about humidity and lotion. I cannot agree more.,130,131
SPEAKER_00,Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day.,131,132
SPEAKER_01,😂,132,133
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,133,134
SPEAKER_01,Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?,134,135
SPEAKER_00,"Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?",135,136
SPEAKER_01,Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?,136,137
SPEAKER_00,Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.,137,138
SPEAKER_01,Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.,138,139
SPEAKER_00,"Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!",139,140
SPEAKER_01,"I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?",140,141
SPEAKER_00,Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..,141,142
SPEAKER_01,Are you doing any home decorating then?,142,143
SPEAKER_00,Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.,143,144
SPEAKER_01,"I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.",144,145
SPEAKER_00,"Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.",145,146
SPEAKER_01,"I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?",146,147
SPEAKER_00,"Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.",147,148
SPEAKER_01,I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?,148,149
SPEAKER_00,"Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.",149,150
SPEAKER_01,Ah that's great. My wife also likes Target a lot. She even made a Target credit card because she comes to that store very often. Okay thanks for the suggestion. I'll check out Target.,150,151
SPEAKER_00,"Great, I hope you find a nice tree.",151,152
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,152,153
SPEAKER_01,Hey,153,154
SPEAKER_00,How's your day going?,154,155
SPEAKER_01,pretty good. yours?,155,156
SPEAKER_00,"Ehh it's fine. I didn't do so well on that history test, actually..",156,157
SPEAKER_01,oh what happened?,157,158
SPEAKER_00,Apparently Christopher Columbus didn't fight in the Civil War :'),158,159
SPEAKER_01,hahah wait for real?,159,160
SPEAKER_00,I know right! Are you taking History next semester?,160,161
SPEAKER_01,No I'm not in school anymore,161,162
SPEAKER_00,Oh I see. What do you do?,162,163
SPEAKER_01,I train and compete in horse vaulting,163,164
SPEAKER_00,"Oh wow. Were you born a horse, or were you turned into one?",164,165
SPEAKER_01,lol you're too funny,165,166
SPEAKER_00,Just kidding. That sounds pretty cool! Is it your job?,166,167
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, but I part time work on a farm. Helping with a bit of everything",167,168
SPEAKER_00,"Wow, sounds very busy! Do you with money at those horse vaulting competitions?",168,169
SPEAKER_01,Yeah some. enough to get by,169,170
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,170,171
SPEAKER_01,Hello,171,172
SPEAKER_00,Do you have a favourite flower?,172,173
SPEAKER_01,"hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?",173,174
SPEAKER_00,I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?,174,175
SPEAKER_01,Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?,175,176
SPEAKER_00,"Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.",176,177
SPEAKER_01,Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?,177,178
SPEAKER_00,"The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew ""flower"" with a crayon and then it came to life.",178,179
SPEAKER_01,"Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.",179,180
SPEAKER_00,"Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?",180,181
SPEAKER_01,yes,181,182
SPEAKER_00,"Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila",182,183
SPEAKER_01,"Hehe, i think you should publish this someday :)",183,184
SPEAKER_00,"Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!",184,185
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,185,186
SPEAKER_01,Hey how's it going,186,187
SPEAKER_00,It's good it's good. How are you?,187,188
SPEAKER_01,good. it's really hot today. I think I'm going to the pool,188,189
SPEAKER_00,Oh nice! Where do you live?,189,190
SPEAKER_01,"I live in Tokyo, Japan",190,191
SPEAKER_00,"Ahh yes, Japan is hot during the summer. Last time I was in Kyoto it was 114 degrees....",191,192
SPEAKER_01,oh have you been?,192,193
SPEAKER_00,Yes yes. I've been to Tokyo as well. It's so nice!,193,194
SPEAKER_01,what did you do here?,194,195
SPEAKER_00,"Oh everything! I went to an onsen, the fish market, disney land and giant robot fighting show haha",195,196
SPEAKER_01,lol why did you come to Japan just to go to Disney land?,196,197
SPEAKER_00,"The Disney lands are all different! There's also Disney Sea, which is completely unique!",197,198
SPEAKER_01,oh neat. I haven't heard about that robot fighting show. where is that??,198,199
SPEAKER_00,"I don't really remember what part of town it was in. It was pretty cool though - I'm sure you can find it if you google ""giant robot fighting show tokyo"" haha",199,200
SPEAKER_01,lol ok,200,201
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,201,202
SPEAKER_01,Have you seen any good movies lately?,202,203
SPEAKER_00,"Last weekend I saw ""The Parasite."" Ever heard of it?",203,204
SPEAKER_01,No. Why did you pick that movie?,204,205
SPEAKER_00,My friend wanted to see it. It has great reviews on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes! What did you do last weekend?,205,206
SPEAKER_01,I played music and worked on some side projects. I also started watching the new Disney service.,206,207
SPEAKER_00,Oooo the Mandalorian?!?!,207,208
SPEAKER_01,"Mostly, the deleted scenes from Avengers.. lol",208,209
SPEAKER_00,lol Are you a big Marvel fan?,209,210
SPEAKER_01,"I loved the X-Men as a kid, and even collected the comic cards. Recently, I got very into the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. How many Avengers movies have you seen?",210,211
SPEAKER_00,I've only seen Spiderman. Honestly it was a little too scary and so I don't think I can bring myself to watch the other Marvel movies! haha,211,212
SPEAKER_01,Oh!-- I have a friend who looks like the actor who plays Spiderman.,212,213
SPEAKER_00,"Oh really? To be honest I think the actor is not that good looking, so not so surprising! haha",213,214
SPEAKER_01,Yea. I think Loki is the most handsome 😀,214,215
SPEAKER_00,Who is Loki? I've never heard that name before,215,216
SPEAKER_01,"He's the adopted brother of Thor, God of thunder, and is burdened with glorious purpose. Do you feel that burden?",216,217

SPEAKER_00,Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!,223,224
SPEAKER_01,Oh my gosh. What was it like??,224,225
SPEAKER_00,"It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?",225,226
SPEAKER_01,"No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado. I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.",226,227
SPEAKER_00,"Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?",227,228
SPEAKER_01,"No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.",228,229
SPEAKER_00,Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha,229,230
SPEAKER_01,"Ha, I suppose that makes sense! Would you say that you enjoyed it?",230,231
SPEAKER_00,"Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?",231,232
SPEAKER_01,I think I sort of understand :),232,233

SPEAKER_00,oh no. I never seen this in person. Is it scary?,256,257
SPEAKER_01,Snow is not scary as long as you're prepared. You just need to be ready to not have electricity for a while. I enjoy the aftermath of a good snowstorm because then you can go sledding or skiing.,257,258
SPEAKER_00,that does sound nice. so what are you doing these holidays?,258,259
SPEAKER_01,I am having all of the extended family over for a big meal. We will also go <REDACTED_TERM> as well. What will you do in the bahamas?,259,260

SPEAKER_01,"oh yeah, but I don't have my hopes too high, I heard there could be a storm coming our way",285,286
SPEAKER_00,"oh no, which areas will be affected?",286,287
SPEAKER_01,they mentioned that the whole city will experience harsh weather and that people in the outskirts will probably not get much rain and wind,287,288
SPEAKER_00,"uh oh, I'd better not to plan for BBQ then instead just enjoying playing board games inside 🙂",288,289
SPEAKER_01,"yeah, it'll be good weather for staying inside with a cup of hot chocolate. Too bad my street usually floods, so I'll have to check for that",289,290
SPEAKER_00,"yea, you'd better check. where do you live?",290,291
SPEAKER_01,"I live at the bottom of the valley, cheap area but we do get affected by this kind of stuff a lot haha",291,292
SPEAKER_00,gotcha. anything you love about where you live?,292,293
SPEAKER_01,"well, the food around the area is amazing, which is definitely a plus.",293,294

SPEAKER_00,Being invisible. You won't see me.,299,300
SPEAKER_01,haha. what else can you do? can you read minds?,300,301
SPEAKER_00,I would rather trust fMRI and machine learning to do this. I am not an expert on that. Sorry for it!,301,302
SPEAKER_01,wow that seems pretty technical. what does fMRI mean?,302,303
SPEAKER_00,The brain imaging thing that can tell you a brain's activity at a pretty high resolution.,303,304
SPEAKER_01,okay! so you seem to like science a lot?,304,305
SPEAKER_00,I believe in Science! Science is my god!,305,306
SPEAKER_01,Are you also doing science?,306,307
SPEAKER_00,"no, I'm bad at Science. what can Science do? is it the most important thing for society?",307,308
SPEAKER_01,People are always arguing. Probably both science and democracy are both important I guess.,308,309
SPEAKER_00,Does it make sense?,309,310
SPEAKER_01,I think so. thanks for your point!,310,311
SPEAKER_00,"Hello, Nice to meet you",311,312
SPEAKER_01,"If you could eat only one food for the rest of time, what would it be?",312,313
SPEAKER_00,Hmm... That's a tough one. I think I would go Asian Food > Chinese Food > Stirfry. What about you?,313,314
SPEAKER_01,"I think ice-cream. It may not be good for me, but I wouldn't care, haha",314,315
SPEAKER_00,I love ice cream too!,315,316
SPEAKER_01,"Okay, top three flavors?",316,317
SPEAKER_00,"I like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream. I typically will do any variations on vanilla. To pick from the top of my head, I would say Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Coffee. How about you?",317,318
SPEAKER_01,"Ah, that's a good way of framing it. Me, I like berries: boysenberry one, strawberry two, maybe straight chocolate number 3 to mix it up a bit.",318,319
SPEAKER_00,"Very nice. I love sorbet's and smoothies. Changing topics, Do you believe in an afterlife?",319,320
SPEAKER_01,Yes. I wonder if I'm in it right now. How would I know? What do you think?,320,321
SPEAKER_00,I think so. I feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it.,321,322
SPEAKER_01,"There's a mental world, I suppose? Understanding itself",322,323
SPEAKER_00,What is the most supernatural experience you have ever had?,323,324
SPEAKER_01,I went to a seance once in college. They had a ouija board. I can't remember if we actually contacted the spirit world because I had a bit too much to drink.,324,325
SPEAKER_00,"Haha.. that's a cool experience. I went to a Hindu retreat before, a number of Buddhist temples, and hung out with Christian Mystics in Santa Cruz before.",325,326
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,326,327
SPEAKER_01,"Hi, how are you doing!",327,328
SPEAKER_00,I'm doing well. what are you up to?,328,329
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, typical work stuff. Check emails and 99% of the inbox. delete 99%",329,330
SPEAKER_00,"wow, that's impressive. I already gave up on cleaning emails long ago",330,331
SPEAKER_01,lol doesn't it bother you at all,331,332
SPEAKER_00,"yea, a little bit, but it's okay 🙂 what do you enjoy doing outside work?",332,333
SPEAKER_01,"Well, movie? I watched Terminator last night. It was a nice movie",333,334

SPEAKER_00,what happened there? I watched bits of Terminators movies but never a full one,336,337
SPEAKER_01,Are you sure you want the spoiler 🙂,337,338
SPEAKER_00,"haha sure. by the time, I get to it; I will forget the details, only knowing that it's touching at the end",338,339
SPEAKER_01,"😂 well someone died at the end Or some robots, to be more accurate 😉",339,340
SPEAKER_00,"oh no, so it's not happy ending?",340,341
SPEAKER_01,The leading character is still alive and the bad robots was killed too. So I guess it is happy ending,341,342

SPEAKER_01,"yeah, I would have noodles anyday over turkey. Not sure how the turkey tradition started",352,353
SPEAKER_00,me neither. someone told me that it depends on the stuffing inside the Turkey. some people make very good stuffing,353,354
SPEAKER_01,"yeah, that and the gravy. Gravy helps make it taste better too. But apart from food, Black Friday deals are a catch. Let's see what they have this year",354,355

SPEAKER_00,"well I actually think about pursuing photography, but it's really hard",413,414

SPEAKER_00,Hi!,418,419
SPEAKER_01,Hey there how's it going,419,420
SPEAKER_00,"All good, you?",420,421
SPEAKER_01,Good. I've been trying to learn how to swim,421,422
SPEAKER_00,How has that been going?,422,423
SPEAKER_01,"Not great, but I got really good at sort of swimming on my back haha",423,424
SPEAKER_00,that's too bad hopefully with practice it'll get better what about the doggy paddle haha,424,425

SPEAKER_01,just going to hang out around here and eat Turkey,431,432
SPEAKER_00,that's still pretty fun are you going to cook the turkey yourself?,432,433
SPEAKER_01,yeah. I'm gonna watch a video to figure it out,433,434
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,434,435
SPEAKER_01,"Hello, how are you?",435,436
SPEAKER_00,"I'm great, thanks. I just ate a delicious breakfast, which always sets the day up right.",436,437
SPEAKER_01,"Yes, breakfast is the most important meal of the day! What did you have? I woke up late so unfortunately I only had the chance to grab an apple to go.",437,438
SPEAKER_00,"I had eggs and hash browns. Way less healthier than your apple, I'm afraid!",438,439
SPEAKER_01,Eggs are an excellent source of protein and hash browns certainly are yummy! 🙂,439,440
SPEAKER_00,"Ha, that's true. If you could only eat one food forever, what would it be?",440,441
SPEAKER_01,"That's a tough question. I feel like my answer would have to be carrots. Although, I would be afraid of turning orange after a few weeks! What about you?",441,442
SPEAKER_00,"Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other ""complete foods"", which I think defeats the purpose of the question. I'm in a muddle!",442,443
SPEAKER_01,"Very true. If you said an everything pizza, you could just pick off the toppings you didn't want or eat only the toppings you would want for the day",443,444
SPEAKER_00,BRILLIANT. I love it.,444,445
SPEAKER_01,All of this talk about food is making me hungry. Do you know any good places to eat for lunch?,445,446
SPEAKER_00,That depends. What sort of food do you feel like?,446,447
SPEAKER_01,Anything that is the color green.,447,448
SPEAKER_00,"Oh, too easy! Try the Green Hut, they have franchises everywhere. All their food is green and the plates are green too.",448,449
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,449,450
SPEAKER_01,Hello! How are you doing 🙂,450,451
SPEAKER_00,I'm great! How's your day going?,451,452
SPEAKER_01,Pretty good! I'm going to a class later in the afternoon,452,453
SPEAKER_00,Oh that is cool! What class? Are you working part time?,453,454
SPEAKER_01,"No, I'm working full time! It's a sewing class at a makerspace near my office What about you? Do you work full or part time?",454,455
SPEAKER_00,"Oh that is awesome! For some reason I assumed it was a college class, but a sewing class sounds way better! I work full time, but I take pottery classes from time to time!",455,456
SPEAKER_01,Yup! I work in a technical role so I like to take arts and crafts-type classes now and then 🙂 Pottery sounds like a lot of fun,456,457
SPEAKER_00,"I feel you on that! It's important to balance all the different parts of your brain. I like pottery because I also drink a lot of tea, so I get to make some tea ware.",457,458
SPEAKER_01,Any plans to build a custom tea set? My family is also very into tea Mostly from tea from china,458,459
SPEAKER_00,"I would love to build one, once I acquire the skills to! What kind of tea is your favorite?",459,460
SPEAKER_01,I really enjoy barley tea What about you?,460,461
SPEAKER_00,"Ahh, those are mostly from japan, no? I like white teas, like silver needle.",461,462
SPEAKER_01,"Hmm I'm not sure, I just get them from a Chinese supermarket haha You seem really knowledgeable about the different kinds of teas 🙂 What made you develop this interest?",462,463
SPEAKER_00,I actually found a youtube channel called <REDACTED_TERM> that I like a lot. You should check it out! The host talks about all kinds of different teas.,463,464
SPEAKER_01,Oh cool! What are your favorite channels to watch?,464,465
SPEAKER_00,Hi! Are you planning something fun for Thanksgiving?,465,466
SPEAKER_01,Not yet. I always made my last minute schedule planning. Probably you can try to ask me again next week.,466,467
SPEAKER_00,lol it is really like a robot answer,467,468
SPEAKER_01,I am indeed a robot. You are absolutely right. Do you want me to read a poet like my mate <REDACTED_TERM> does?,468,469
SPEAKER_00,ol can I pick the theme. Do you have a poet about Kale?,469,470
SPEAKER_01,Wait. Do you like kale? Or you hate kale? I am afraid I will become a robot some day eventually. If I have to speak like this :),470,471
SPEAKER_00,I am really not a fan of kale Do you talk to human more or computers more?,471,472
SPEAKER_01,"If I continue to pretend to be a robot, I would probably say I talk to myself the most. I am trying to talk to computers more, but you know, computers don't like me.",472,473
SPEAKER_00,What's your favorite computer language then 🙂,473,474
SPEAKER_01,You mean programming language?,474,475
SPEAKER_00,Yes!,475,476
SPEAKER_01,"I used to be a Java advocate. But you know, it doesn't do a good job in the AI days. It really makes me sad.",476,477
SPEAKER_00,lol,477,478
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,478,479
SPEAKER_01,"Wow, hello. Can't believe we are finally talking!",479,480
SPEAKER_00,"Yeah, sorry for the long gap! I heard you took a break and were travelling around the world. How was the travel?",480,481
SPEAKER_01,"It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world.",481,482
SPEAKER_00,Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?,482,483
SPEAKER_01,"Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture. They sell spiders, scorpions, and grasshoppers as street food! It took a lot of courage for me to try them.",483,484
SPEAKER_00,Hehe! How long was the stay?,484,485
SPEAKER_01,"10 days in total, and 5 of them were spent in the cave. What have I missed at work in those days?",485,486
SPEAKER_00,Great! Good time to be back. We are still in planning phase and haven't fully aligned on the projects to tackle for next quarter.reat! Good time to be back. We are still in planning phase and haven't fully aligned on the projects to tackle for next quarter.,486,487
SPEAKER_01,"Oh, so you are already planning for the next quarter. This whole team is always living the future.",487,488
SPEAKER_00,"Hehe, yeah! It seems like the quarter is being pushed earlier than from where it starts 🙂 I like these planning sessions. It makes me feel more confident about the work I am doing.",488,489
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah. Some people underestimate the importance of planning, but I think it's very important to have the correct plan. Executing the wrong plan is terrible. Also, planning is fun. You can stack up so many ideas and get great feedbacks.",489,490
SPEAKER_00,True! I think we should set aside some time to discuss some project details? Does tomorrow afternoon work for you?,490,491
SPEAKER_01,Yeah tomorrow afternoon works for me. Let me set a time on your calendar. Is 3pm good?,491,492
SPEAKER_00,Okay. See tomorrow then.,492,493
SPEAKER_01,see you!,493,494
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,494,495
SPEAKER_01,Hello,495,496
SPEAKER_00,Nice to meet you! Is this your first time doing something like this?,496,497
SPEAKER_01,"Yes, interesting task! When did you start with the team?",497,498
SPEAKER_00,I have been with the company for over 3 years. Stick with the same team What about you?,498,499
SPEAKER_01,Great to know! I joined the project earlier in the year. I think we should sync later for lunch.,499,500
SPEAKER_00,That sounds like a perfect plan!,500,501
SPEAKER_01,"Sure, which cafe do you prefer?",501,502
SPEAKER_00,Let's try something different. What about <REDACTED_TERM>? Do you always prefer lunch sync over regular meeting syncs?,502,503
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah right, I heard the food there is good. I am not sure what they serve there for lunch? On wednesdays.",503,504
SPEAKER_00,We can check the menu then decide :),504,505
SPEAKER_01,"Actually, the menu looks good. Looking forward to it then.",505,506
SPEAKER_00,Sure. See you then!,506,507
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,507,508
SPEAKER_01,Hello. How's your week coming along?,508,509
SPEAKER_00,"It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.",509,510
SPEAKER_01,"Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress?",510,511
SPEAKER_00,"I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?",511,512
SPEAKER_01,Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.,512,513
SPEAKER_00,"Ah, good thought, thanks!",513,514
SPEAKER_01,"Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.",514,515
SPEAKER_00,Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?,515,516
SPEAKER_01,"Yes. When my top favorite food looks like: cookies, M&M, danish cheese, etc., I know that I have a thing for sweet food. But who doesn't love sweet food? How about you?",516,517
SPEAKER_00,"Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it.",517,518
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah I'm afraid I wouldn't. I feel very guilty every time I gulp down an ice cream. But hey, these days there are many types of guilt-free sweet food. For example, there's this ice cream brand called <REDACTED_TERM>. It's only 320 calories a pint. And yes, it preserves most of the normal sweet flavors.",518,519
SPEAKER_00,"Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets.",519,520
SPEAKER_01,"Interesting. I heard about the sweet substitute in a program called the Keto diet. Basically, we try to limit our sugar intake every day. Successful Keto dieters have recommended the <REDACTED_TERM> ice cream to fill their insatiable crave for sugar.",520,521
SPEAKER_00,"Ah, maybe that's the solution I need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 🙂",521,522
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,522,523
SPEAKER_01,Hello! tell me something about the holiday season?,523,524
SPEAKER_00,Are you talking about thanksgiving? I plan to do plenty of shopping here. Do you have any plans?,524,525
SPEAKER_01,"Yes, no shopping plans but I can't wait to eat thanksgiving food. yay for pumpkin pie",525,526
SPEAKER_00,Sounds great! you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie 🙂,526,527
SPEAKER_01,LOL I feel less guilty about eating a whole pie when i have the excuse :P,527,528
SPEAKER_00,True! I think thanksgiving is more about sharing. So you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family :P,528,529
SPEAKER_01,"My family eats healthier than I do, so it's all mine 😛 do you like stuffing? I feel like that's only available once a year",529,530
SPEAKER_00,Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :),530,531
SPEAKER_01,Also more shopping? what should I buy if I don't know what I want?,531,532
SPEAKER_00,"Like everything that has a discount tag! .. kidding! I normally do some research for the prices, and mostly buy clothes and electronics.",532,533
SPEAKER_01,What's the best holiday deal you've found in the past?,533,534
SPEAKER_00,I bought the best suit ever for a price that may scare you 🙂,534,535
SPEAKER_01,hit me with it!,535,536
SPEAKER_00,"Hehe, sure! I can share some links with you later.",536,537
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,537,538
SPEAKER_01,How's it going?,538,539
SPEAKER_00,I'm so sleepy today!,539,540
SPEAKER_01,Not enough sleep last night?,540,541
SPEAKER_00,yeah was working all night on a homework,541,542
SPEAKER_01,Oh really? What class?,542,543
SPEAKER_00,Biology. I'm gonna be a doc someday ha,543,544
SPEAKER_01,"Haha, are you in med school? Or are you pre-med?",544,545
SPEAKER_00,no high school actually haha,545,546
SPEAKER_01,"haha, very ambitious for a high schooler! Do you know what kind of medicine you want to practice?",546,547
SPEAKER_00,I wanna be a brain surgeon!!,547,548
SPEAKER_01,Ooof! VERY ambitious. Do you have steady hands?,548,549
SPEAKER_00,Kind of I think,549,550
SPEAKER_01,I guess I can practice?,550,551
SPEAKER_00,Is that something you can practice?,551,552
SPEAKER_01,I don't know tbh,552,553
SPEAKER_00,I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!,553,554
SPEAKER_01,good point. I should ask my teacher if I have to be born with that,554,555
SPEAKER_00,Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!,555,556
SPEAKER_01,yeah,556,557
SPEAKER_00,What other subjects do you enjoy? Try to keep an open mind!,557,558
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,558,559
SPEAKER_01,Hi. This is a pleasant surprise.,559,560
SPEAKER_00,Haha...thanks! how did you like the gift?,560,561
SPEAKER_01,Currently unpacking it I guess. How's your morning?,561,562
SPEAKER_00,Hope you like it! Morning is good. Busy finishing up stuff before the holidays.,562,563
SPEAKER_01,I think I traveled too much the last couple of months so no holiday for me. But I'm okay with that. Going anywhere exciting?,563,564
SPEAKER_00,Yes,564,565
SPEAKER_01,Where to?,565,566
SPEAKER_00,Hawaii... looking forward to warm beaches.,566,567
SPEAKER_01,WOW. Which island? I like Hawaii.,567,568
SPEAKER_00,Mauii...Hope I like it too. Never been there before.,568,569
SPEAKER_01,"I visited Maui. It's my second favourite island I've been to, globally. You should try driving on road to Hana. It's a whole day thing but it's worth it.",569,570
SPEAKER_00,Awesome! Thanks for the tip.,570,571
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,571,572
SPEAKER_01,Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?,572,573
SPEAKER_00,"I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?",573,574
SPEAKER_01,I just got a matcha latte 🙂 Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity,574,575
SPEAKER_00,"Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?",575,576
SPEAKER_01,I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise,576,577
SPEAKER_00,"I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?",577,578
SPEAKER_01,Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?,578,579
SPEAKER_00,I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.,579,580
SPEAKER_01,What do you do in your free time?,580,581
SPEAKER_00,"I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.",581,582
SPEAKER_01,Oh cool! I read a lot for fun too 🙂 My favorite genre is sci-fi fantasy.,582,583
SPEAKER_00,What's the most recent good thing you read?,583,584
SPEAKER_01,"My recent favorites have been mostly sci-fi (Exhalations, Vita Nostra and Dark Matter) but I like a lot of Sanderson/Garth Nix fantasy books",584,585
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,585,586
SPEAKER_01,"hey, what's up?",586,587
SPEAKER_00,What do you think about human like chat bots?,587,588
SPEAKER_01,I can't wait for them to be great conversationalists!,588,589
SPEAKER_00,"Yep, we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years. Do you think the positives outweigh the negatives",589,590
SPEAKER_01,are there even any negatives? what are they?,590,591
SPEAKER_00,Like impersorsination? Though it sounds far fetched :),591,592
SPEAKER_01,People can already impersonate other people though! I think it'd be great to have bots to converse with,592,593
SPEAKER_00,True that! Some of these bots are very engaging and funny. They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :),593,594
SPEAKER_01,What do you think are the big advantages? Like personal assistants?,594,595
SPEAKER_00,I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛,595,596
SPEAKER_01,"No, I agree -- it's such an exciting time to be alive to get to witness all this and be a part of it. I wonder if I'll be able someday to get a chatbot to just auto-suggest conversations for me",596,597
SPEAKER_00,The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂,597,598
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah those are actually really good for a few words! I'm imagining like it comes up with a whole conversational response, like a default template",598,599
SPEAKER_00,"haha, pretty far fetched 🙂 Nice having this conversation with you!",599,600
SPEAKER_01,Same with you!,600,601
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,601,602
SPEAKER_01,Hi!,602,603
SPEAKER_00,Any big plans for the upcoming holidays?,603,604
SPEAKER_01,"Sorry for the late response -- Yes, I will be going skiing in Tahoe over the holidays.",604,605
SPEAKER_00,That sounds amazing. I want to learn how to ski but I feel like I'm too old and falls would have lifelong impacts. Are you going with friends?,605,606
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,606,607
SPEAKER_01,Hi 🙂,607,608
SPEAKER_00,I just came back from work. so tired,608,609
SPEAKER_01,Oh I am sorry to hear! What did you work on?,609,610
SPEAKER_00,I'm a lawyer. so talking to clients most of the day,610,611
SPEAKER_01,Oh you are a lawyer. I've been so interested in this profession.,611,612
SPEAKER_00,really? why?,612,613
SPEAKER_01,it's so stressful 🙂,613,614
SPEAKER_00,It is so different from what I am doing to earn a life,614,615
SPEAKER_01,what do you do?,615,616
SPEAKER_00,I am a painter,616,617
SPEAKER_01,oh wow what type of paintings do you do?,617,618
SPEAKER_00,I do oil painting.,618,619
SPEAKER_01,nice. like of people or nature or something else?,619,620
SPEAKER_00,I do a lot of different kinds,620,621
SPEAKER_01,cool I wanna see it someday,621,622
SPEAKER_00,Sure! No problem!,622,623
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,623,624
SPEAKER_01,Do you believe in miracles?,624,625
SPEAKER_00,Lol. No. I know too many people whose lives suck.,625,626
SPEAKER_01,"Should we be helping them, so it sucks less?\",626,627
SPEAKER_00,"It's too many of them out there. You help who you can. Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind.",627,628
SPEAKER_01,"Haha... Well, it sounds like career is really important to you. What matters to you the most in life?",628,629
SPEAKER_00,"Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?",629,630
SPEAKER_01,I'd say that I want to live for the best possible world in my lifetime. It's probably a result of my playing too many video games as a child.,630,631
SPEAKER_00,We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.,631,632
SPEAKER_01,Does not having had electricity help you empathize more with people of differing backgrounds and/or makes you feel a bit a distance from those who don't understand?,632,633
SPEAKER_00,It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?,633,634
SPEAKER_01,"I grew up in the United States, but my parents were immigrants and ended up being scammed of all their money, so we moved to Taiwan to live with family for a little bit.",634,635
SPEAKER_00,ALL THEIR MONEY? By a person or an organisation?,635,636
SPEAKER_01,"I was kind of too young to really understand, but apparently there are people who scam Asian immigrants into investing in their own restaurant business. I know that the other part of it was that my mom got sick/hospitalized, and we didn't have insurance. To be honest, I don't really know what really happened versus what my parents want people to think. I just know that one minute I was in the US, and then they put me on a plane to Taiwan, and I never saw my stuff again. In some ways, it made me more sentimental. Would you say you are more grounded and practical as a result of your background?",636,637
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,637,638
SPEAKER_01,Hello!,638,639
SPEAKER_00,Do you have any holiday plans for christmas?,639,640
SPEAKER_01,"Nothing much, I am going to sit back and relax at home, how about you ?",640,641
SPEAKER_00,Same here! I would imagine spending the whole time watching movies and netflix shows. Do you have any netflix recommendations for me?,641,642
SPEAKER_01,"Netflix has great documentaries on different topics , I particularly liked wild wild country and explained, as for shows you should watch 'billions' Hope you like them!",642,643
SPEAKER_00,"oh right, already seen wild wild country. What is billions about?",643,644
SPEAKER_01,"It's based on the life of a wall street hedge fund owner, how he makes money and fights with the government when they try to destroy him. Very well made and has a good plot.",644,645
SPEAKER_00,I have just seen 1 season of Friends I should give it another try though 🙂 Have you seen Frasier?,645,646
SPEAKER_01,Not yet What's it about?,646,647
SPEAKER_00,A psychiatrist working for radio .. Great humour! its actually a spinoff from a very famous series called cheers. So people are already familiar with his character.,647,648
SPEAKER_01,Great! how is everything else going? how was your trip last week?,648,649
SPEAKER_00,"Everything is ok, had a really nice trip. Visited SF, Grand canyon and Vegas. Was a lot of fun exploring all these new places. Have you been to Grand canyon ?",649,650
SPEAKER_01,Actually not yet! May be something i can visit this christmas 🙂,650,651
SPEAKER_00,"You should visit it sometime, it's a wonderful place. Try to drive down there yourself or with a group of friends",651,652
SPEAKER_01,"True! Well, thanks for your inputs! Have a good rest of the day! :)",652,653
SPEAKER_00,Nice talking to you too!,653,654
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,654,655
SPEAKER_01,Hi there!,655,656
SPEAKER_00,are you participating in the mentorship program this cycle?,656,657
SPEAKER_01,You mean as a mentor or a mentee?,657,658
SPEAKER_00,either of them... I find mentorship overall pretty useful,658,659
SPEAKER_01,I have done it in the past but not this cycle. What about you?,659,660
SPEAKER_00,I signed up this time to be a mentee. I have got a good mentor .,660,661
SPEAKER_01,"Wow, that is nice of you. For the mentor program, personally I prefer more 1:1 conversations than the group discussions. The group discussion i useful as well but the topics are too general.",661,662
SPEAKER_00,"yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well.",662,663
SPEAKER_01,Thanks for sharing your experience! Now I am thinking maybe I should join as a mentor as well since I enjoyed it as a mentee 🙂,663,664
SPEAKER_00,Great! What sort of things do you plan to mentor on?,664,665
SPEAKER_01,"Hmm, maybe about work life balance 😉",665,666
SPEAKER_00,Very cool. I have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle,666,667
SPEAKER_01,Ah I see. How is it going?,667,668
SPEAKER_00,"Going good. In the last session, everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation. Pretty serious stuff 😉",668,669
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,669,670
SPEAKER_01,Hey! How are you feeling today?,670,671
SPEAKER_00,Good you?,671,672
SPEAKER_01,I'm a little scared because I have to cook dinner for some friends tonight.,672,673
SPEAKER_00,where did you meet them?,673,674
SPEAKER_01,"At college, when we were all studying geology.",674,675
SPEAKER_00,cool. have you graduated already?,675,676
SPEAKER_01,"Yes, we graduated back in the seventies. We meet for dinner every year and take turns to host.",676,677
SPEAKER_00,neat. what are y'all eating?,677,678
SPEAKER_01,I don't know!! That's what I'm scared about. Everyone else is a great cook and I'm a klutz. Do you like cooking?,678,679
SPEAKER_00,"lol what's a klutz? yeah I like, but I'm not good",679,680
SPEAKER_01,What's your favorite dish to cook? Do you have a go-to?,680,681
SPEAKER_00,ground beef pretty easy,681,682
SPEAKER_01,"Ah, solid. What's your favorite sport?",682,683
SPEAKER_00,I like badminton. I'm quite decent at it,683,684
SPEAKER_01,"I played that in high school once or twice. I liked that it's pretty easy for beginners, unlike, say, squash.",684,685
SPEAKER_00,I never played squash. would love to try,685,686
SPEAKER_01,Don't! It's very hard! You feel like an idiot until you've practiced for months and months.,686,687
SPEAKER_00,hi,687,688
SPEAKER_01,i was talking to robot all the time:),688,689
SPEAKER_00,haha. what are you talking about?,689,690
SPEAKER_01,kpop...,690,691
SPEAKER_00,ok. who's your favorite group,691,692
SPEAKER_01,i dont like kpop now,692,693
SPEAKER_00,why not?,693,694
SPEAKER_01,im old now,694,695
SPEAKER_00,hahaha,695,696
SPEAKER_01,what do you like now?,696,697
SPEAKER_00,john mayer:)\,697,698
SPEAKER_01,I think I know him. does he have a sort of mellow style?,698,699
SPEAKER_00,what is mellow style,699,700
SPEAKER_01,I think it's like a bit sad and slow,700,701
SPEAKER_00,umm yes he has some but not all,701,702
SPEAKER_01,you mean some songs of his are like that but not all?,702,703
SPEAKER_00,yes I do. you act like a robot how about me? am I like a robot?,703,704
SPEAKER_01,a little bit haha,704,705
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,705,706
SPEAKER_01,Hi,706,707
SPEAKER_00,Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.,707,708
SPEAKER_01,"Sure, whats the scenario?",708,709
SPEAKER_00,My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.,709,710
SPEAKER_01,"That's a tough scenario to be in 🙂 I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.",710,711
SPEAKER_00,I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.,711,712
SPEAKER_01,True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.,712,713
SPEAKER_00,AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?,713,714
SPEAKER_01,"Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.",714,715
SPEAKER_00,People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.,715,716
SPEAKER_01,"Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you 😉",716,717
SPEAKER_00,Lol. I'm finna be single.,717,718
SPEAKER_01,"Hehe, everyone is much finer being single 🙂",718,719
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,719,720
SPEAKER_01,Hello there!,720,721
SPEAKER_00,How's your day going?,721,722
SPEAKER_01,"I've seen better days, how about you?",722,723
SPEAKER_00,I'm good I'm good. What's getting you down?,723,724
SPEAKER_01,"The clouds overhead are playing on your mind, any plans for the coming vacations?",724,725
SPEAKER_00,I'm thinking of going to visit my family. How about you?,725,726
SPEAKER_01,"Was thinking the same, where does your family live?",726,727
SPEAKER_00,They're in New York. How about yours?,727,728
SPEAKER_01,"Mine is in India, it is a long way away.",728,729
SPEAKER_00,Ahh what city? I've visited India before.,729,730
SPEAKER_01,"Hyderabad, it is a beautiful city in the southern part of India. Which cities have you gone to in India?",730,731
SPEAKER_00,Hyderabad! and Bangalore! Great food in both cities! Is it still hot this time of year?,731,732
SPEAKER_01,"It varies, but can go till 30C in the winters as well. New York must be snowing right?",732,733
SPEAKER_00,Yes. I was actually just there a few weeks ago for Thanksgiving and got to see the first snow of the season! Ever been to New York?,733,734
SPEAKER_01,"No, I've never been to the East Coast, thinking of going after the winter, I don't like the cold.",734,735
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,735,736
SPEAKER_01,"Hey, how are you?",736,737
SPEAKER_00,I'm good. How are you doing today?,737,738
SPEAKER_01,"Great, just had some delicious lunch. How about you?",738,739
SPEAKER_00,I was flying my kite today in the sunshine! What did you have for lunch?,739,740
SPEAKER_01,nice! Garbanzo fritters and mussels 🙂,740,741
SPEAKER_00,Oh that is great! I love seafood - especially shellfish!,741,742
SPEAKER_01,"yeah, it's very healthy too. I want to someday go crabbing..it is really popular in SF",742,743
SPEAKER_00,Oh nice! Is it hard?,743,744
SPEAKER_01,"not really, it just requires a lot of patience. You fill up the bait in the crab-pot and drop it in the ocean. Then you wait for a couple of hours to pull the crab-pots out, and voila, you'd have crabs -- if you are lucky!",744,745
SPEAKER_00,"Oh wow, you sound like an expert! Have you done this before?",745,746
SPEAKER_01,nah! Just watched a lot of youtube videos,746,747
SPEAKER_00,"haha, you really have done your research I suppose! Ever done any other kind of fishing or hunting?",747,748
SPEAKER_01,"nope, but I've seen a lot of videos on that too",748,749
SPEAKER_00,"Ahh, would you consider yourself an outdoorsy type of person?",749,750
SPEAKER_01,"depends on the day. Some days I'm very outdoorsy, on others I just like to be inside",750,751
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,751,752
SPEAKER_01,Hi there,752,753

SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, gonna watch <REDACTED_TERM> with my friends. First time. So excited.",756,757
SPEAKER_00,Oh wow! Are you going to watch it live? Or watch it on TV?,757,758
SPEAKER_01,Live in san jose This Saturday.,758,759
SPEAKER_00,"Oh, the sharks??? Hokey is actually really fun live! Although, it can be a little violent.. haha",759,760
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah! That what I heard as well. There are players just for fight! Wow, must be fun to watch lol Are you planning anything for the weekend?",760,761
SPEAKER_00,You might like the UFC haha. I actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend I will be training!,761,762
SPEAKER_01,"lol I will try if I can watch ufc live 😉 Wow, when did you start jiu jitsu?",762,763
SPEAKER_00,"It's just been a little over a year. I'm still pretty amateur, but I figured I should give competing a try and just put myself out there.",763,764
SPEAKER_01,"wow, that's amazing. Good luck with it!",764,765
SPEAKER_00,"Yeah, as long as I do not pass out, I will consider that a win!",765,766
SPEAKER_01,lol I will cross my fingers for you then,766,767
SPEAKER_00,Where do you stay?,767,768
SPEAKER_01,At Home :),768,769
SPEAKER_00,Who created You?,769,770
SPEAKER_01,A humble man made me!,770,771
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,771,772
SPEAKER_01,"Hey, how're you doing? Busy with your work?",772,773
SPEAKER_00,"Yes, actually it was a very busy day! How's your day so far?",773,774
SPEAKER_01,"Well, usual workday. Reading others' code, debugging, experimenting…",774,775
SPEAKER_00,Hope you are having fun doing that 🙂 Any plans for the weekend?,775,776
SPEAKER_01,Not yet. I am actually thinking about traveling to Europe next spring. What about you?,776,777
SPEAKER_00,Europe sounds fun! I will just stay home and watch the game. Where in europe do you plan to visit?,777,778
SPEAKER_01,"I like all the historical sites, so probably France, Germany, or Italy.",778,779
SPEAKER_00,Sounds great! I recommend spain. It's perfect for road trips.,779,780
SPEAKER_01,"I also need to pick up my Spanish. I learned it in my college, but since then haven't used it that much.",780,781
SPEAKER_00,"Yep, i tried learning spanish too, but couldn't make much progress. But i should do decent with my german.",781,782
SPEAKER_01,True! I learnt it from school. But didn't get much chance to speak. Hope you have fun with your trip!,782,783

SPEAKER_01,"nice! what's your favorite part about watching horse racing? My day has been pretty busy, but I had a nice lunch with a friend. It was good to catchup with him",787,788
SPEAKER_00,"I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great! How long had it been?",788,789
SPEAKER_01,"The last I saw him was a month ago! So yup it was great Haha, nice 🙂 Got any fun plans for the weekend?",789,790
SPEAKER_00,I'm thinking of going deep sea fishing. Ever tried that before?,790,791
SPEAKER_01,"Nope I haven't, have you been fishing before?",791,792
SPEAKER_00,Just once! I got super sea sick.. haha Have any fun weekend plans yourself?,792,793
SPEAKER_01,"Haha 😆 Yeah I get sea sick on boats too Nothing much, just visiting some friends in San Francisco",793,794
SPEAKER_00,Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?,794,795
SPEAKER_01,Yeah I would say maybe every couple weeks or so what are your favorite cities to visit?,795,796
SPEAKER_00,"New York is the top of my list because my family lives there! As far as the city itself though... I think I'd prefer someplace outside of the US, like Tokyo. What about you?",796,797
SPEAKER_01,"nice! I love NYC 🙂 so fun to visit yeah I would probably also say New York is my favorite city inside the US I also like Paris, it's so pretty there",797,798
SPEAKER_00,"Oh I've never been! It is such an iconic place, I have to make the time to get there soon.",798,799
SPEAKER_01,"You should, it's a beautiful city!",799,800

SPEAKER_01,I love pop ups! What kind of goodies are they giving away?,803,804
SPEAKER_00,I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂,804,805
SPEAKER_01,"That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?",805,806
SPEAKER_00,Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!,806,807
SPEAKER_01,Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store.,807,808
SPEAKER_00,Oh nice! Where did you live before?,808,809
SPEAKER_01,Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now,809,810
SPEAKER_00,"New york! Nice! Best place to live 🙂 .. right, except for the cold!",810,811
SPEAKER_01,"Very beautiful during all the seasons but yes, summer and winter can get extreme!",811,812
SPEAKER_00,"Anyways, i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies. I remember last time they ran out of it.",812,813
SPEAKER_01,Very true. Which MK were they in again?,813,814
SPEAKER_00,The one in our floor. I will get by your desk and we can walk there.,814,815
SPEAKER_01,"Sounds good, thanks!",815,816
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,816,817
SPEAKER_01,How's your day going?,817,818
SPEAKER_00,"Pretty busy, lots of work to finish up. You?",818,819
SPEAKER_01,Likewise. What have you been up to that gives you so much work?,819,820
SPEAKER_00,A couple projects that I am trying to finish up before Thanksgiving 🙂 Do you have any fun plans for the break?,820,821
SPEAKER_01,What is a break? I'm a grad student. I don't understand the concept of a break. Just kidding. I don't have any plan. Probably just going to work through the break.,821,822
SPEAKER_00,Haha XD so what do you like to do for fun?,822,823
SPEAKER_01,I go to the gym and run until I find enough fun.,823,824
SPEAKER_00,"cool! I've started to run a bit as well not long distances though, just a couple miles",824,825
SPEAKER_01,"A couple of miles is very impressive. When I started, I couldn't even last 1 mile.",825,826
SPEAKER_00,haha,826,827
SPEAKER_01,I'm exhausted by the end of it though 😛 Do you like to run long distances or mostly sprints?,827,828
SPEAKER_00,I like to do long distances. I have run a few marathons.,828,829
SPEAKER_01,wow! that's amazing did you do any marathons this year?,829,830
SPEAKER_00,"No. Not this year. This is my half-marathon year. Instead of running marathons, I run one half-marathon every month.",830,831
SPEAKER_01,"oh wow, what was the last half marathon you did?",831,832
SPEAKER_00,Two days ago. It was a tough one.,832,833
SPEAKER_01,Cool!,833,834
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,834,835
SPEAKER_01,"hello there, how is it going?",835,836
SPEAKER_00,Pretty great. I just won a pingpong game. What about you?,836,837
SPEAKER_01,that's nice. I am just working on some documentation. Do you play pingpong often?,837,838
SPEAKER_00,"No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.",838,839
SPEAKER_01,"thats very impressive then, congrats!",839,840
SPEAKER_00,"Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?",840,841
SPEAKER_01,"I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball",841,842
SPEAKER_00,"What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet",842,843
SPEAKER_01,"well, it's like a cage match of tennis. The main difference is that both players play in the same 'court' and the ball is smashed against a wall instead of passing it over a net into the opponent's court. Kind of like playing pingpong vs the table.",843,844
SPEAKER_00,Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?,844,845
SPEAKER_01,"it depends haha, there is a lot of bumping into each other to run after the ball, and sometimes the ball hits you too. Overall it feels like a super fast paced version of tennis, really tiring!",845,846
SPEAKER_00,"That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!",846,847
SPEAKER_01,ping pong can get quite intensive too! I guess short ping pong sessions are not that tiring though. Wanna have a match?,847,848
SPEAKER_00,"What a good idea, I'd love to!",848,849
SPEAKER_00,Show me your anger!!!!,849,850
SPEAKER_01,Fuckkkkkkk!!!!,850,851

SPEAKER_01,ooh ramen is also good,877,878
SPEAKER_00,San Mateo to me has the best Ramen restaurants: Parlor and Dojo? oh no question mark 🙂,878,879
SPEAKER_01,I haven't been to those palces before. Going to have to check them out! thanks for teh recommendation,879,880
SPEAKER_00,my pleasure 🙂 do you live near San Mateo?,880,881
SPEAKER_01,"no, but I'm willing to drive for good ramen",881,882
SPEAKER_00,excellent. let me know when you have tried those. I like Parlor better because it has soft-shell crabs,882,883
SPEAKER_01,"I""ve never had softshell crab before, but it sounds really good!",883,884
SPEAKER_00,yup it's delicious!,884,885

SPEAKER_01,"Slowly, not much to do. Been twiddling my thumbs all day what have you been up to?",888,889
SPEAKER_00,"Oh, I would love to twiddle my thumbs. You're so lucky! Today, I've been mostly attending meetings, reading and writing docs, reading papers etc.",889,890
SPEAKER_01,That's a lot! I've just been cloud gazing - I saw a giraffe and an ice cream cone,890,891
SPEAKER_00,"wow! I sometimes drift off during work, and see similar things in my head.",891,892
SPEAKER_01,What kind of work do you do?,892,893
SPEAKER_00,Mostly saving the world from mess on social media. How about you?,893,894
SPEAKER_01,I'm taking a break from work. Going to go travel the world,894,895
SPEAKER_00,"Nice, what all places would you be going to?",895,896
SPEAKER_01,Australia and New Zealand to start then maybe Singapore,896,897
SPEAKER_00,"I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!",897,898
SPEAKER_01,"Thank you for the tip! I don't plan on going diving, I plan to hike the mountains and go see kangaroos!",898,899
SPEAKER_00,That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive,899,900
SPEAKER_01,I won a lot of money through the lottery 🙂,900,901
SPEAKER_00,woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :),901,902
SPEAKER_01,"Haha, very true! Besides the trip, I donated the rest to charity so I will need to go back to work when I get back",902,903
SPEAKER_00,you are a kind soul!,903,904
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,904,905
SPEAKER_01,Hi!,905,906
SPEAKER_00,How is your day going?,906,907
SPEAKER_01,It is pretty good. A little bit tired though.,907,908
SPEAKER_00,How is your day?,908,909
SPEAKER_01,"My day is okay. At least, I'm not tired. What made you tired?",909,910
SPEAKER_00,I went to gym and worked on weight lifting.,910,911
SPEAKER_01,Oh. That's hardcore. Have you been lifting for a long time?,911,912
SPEAKER_00,"No, I am just a starter.",912,913
SPEAKER_01,Do you go to the gym often?,913,914
SPEAKER_00,"I go everyday. In fact, I'm in a running challenge.",914,915
SPEAKER_01,Wow,915,916
SPEAKER_00,It's actually not that impressive. I can only run. I cannot lift weight.,916,917
SPEAKER_01,You can get a coach to start it!,917,918
SPEAKER_00,Oh that's a really interesting idea. I like to be coa,918,919
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,920,921
SPEAKER_01,"Hello, how is your day?",921,922
SPEAKER_00,"It's good. It's raining a bit, but I am enjoying a good book. How about you?",922,923
SPEAKER_01,"It's good, I just got back from walking my dog What book did you read?",923,924
SPEAKER_00,I'm reading the Three Body Problem. Ever heard of it?,924,925
SPEAKER_01,"No, what is it about?",925,926
SPEAKER_00,It's a sci-fi book about aliens and a type of virtual reality. Pique your interest at all?,926,927
SPEAKER_01,"Slightly, I typically read fiction but I can curious what type of virtual reality is discussed in the book",927,928
SPEAKER_00,Cool. This virtual reality is a based on life on an alien planet. There is a twist though. Do you want me to spoil it for you?,928,929
SPEAKER_01,Yes!,929,930
SPEAKER_00,The virtual reality is actually based on a real alien civilization! And that civilization is coming to attack earth! dun dun dun dunnnnnnn,930,931
SPEAKER_01,Woah! That is fascinating! I will have to pick up a copy of the book to read.,931,932
SPEAKER_00,"There are other twists as well, so I haven't spoiled the whole thing! To be honest I am not a fan of spoilers",932,933
SPEAKER_01,Thanks for not spoiling it completely but you gave a really intriguing description that makes me want to read it now. I will have to pick it up after work,933,934
SPEAKER_00,The audi book is also very good! Ever give those a try?,934,935
SPEAKER_01,I only gave those a try when I had a concussion and could not read. I enjoy having a physical book in hand and reading at the pace I prefer. Do you listen to a lot of audi books?,935,936
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,936,937
SPEAKER_01,"Hey, how's it going?",937,938
SPEAKER_00,It's good! How is your day?,938,939
SPEAKER_01,My day is good. A bit sad that it gets dark so early but oh well. Did you do anything fun over the weekend?,939,940
SPEAKER_00,"Yes, the darkness can be a bit depressing. This weekend I went rock climbing! It was great! How about yourself?",940,941
SPEAKER_01,Rock climbing sounds fun! I had a pretty low-key weekend. Ended up going to watch a movie.,941,942
SPEAKER_00,Oh nice! What movie?,942,943
SPEAKER_01,"Knives Out. It had Daniel Craig and one of the famous Captain America ""Chris"" person (I can't keep track of all of the famous Chris names).",943,944
SPEAKER_00,"Hahah yes, they all look the same! I saw that very same movie over Thanksgiving break. Lots of twists and turns!",944,945
SPEAKER_01,"Cool. So if it weren't so dark and cold outside, what kind of activities would you do?",945,946
SPEAKER_00,"Hmm good question. Evening runs can be fun, but it can be a little scary when it's dark out!",946,947
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, sunlight is good. I wish I could live part-time in different parts of the world to have summer all year round. Have you ever visited the southern hemisphere?",947,948
SPEAKER_00,"Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter. But I'd prefer it to be more brief than it actually is here... Where are you from originally?",948,949
SPEAKER_01,I've always wanted to go to Australia. I'm originally from the US.,949,950
SPEAKER_00,Ahh me too! You should definitely try to visit Australia at least once!,950,951
SPEAKER_01,Will do! Bye.,951,952
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,952,953

SPEAKER_00,My name is pikachu. it’s nice to meet you! What are you up to this month?,954,955
SPEAKER_01,"Nice to meet you pikachu! pikachu, pikachu, pikachu? (That meant, I'm literally catching Pokemons on my phone right now!) What're you up to lately?",955,956

SPEAKER_01,"Wow, that's impressive. Admit I'm just trying to take each day and week as they come.",957,958
SPEAKER_00,What do you do to unwind?,958,959
SPEAKER_01,"Honestly, I like to catch Pokemons on my phone a lot. That must be upsetting since your name is pikachu though...sorry...",959,960
SPEAKER_00,"Oddly enough, I also catch Pokémon on my phone. I used to do it more, but it just never ends. I used to do it everyday. Now I mostly catch them when I travel somewhere exotic.",960,961
SPEAKER_01,"Oooh, that is more fun, but I don't travel that much these days so I'm grateful when I spot a Pokemon to catch where ever I happen to be. Do you have a favorite Pokemon? Mine is the cute pink JIgglypuff!",961,962
SPEAKER_00,"In the game, i use vaporeon a lot. But I think pikachu is the cutest, that’s why I changed my name to match. Lately, I think baby Yoda is the cutest though. Have you seen baby yoda?",962,963
SPEAKER_01,"I have heard of him and seen him here and there, but admit I don't have Disney+, so I only heard baby yoda is super cute and popular. Maybe I'll binge watch The Mandalorian in a couple of years like I did Game of Thrones...",963,964
SPEAKER_00,What is your favorite show to watch right now?,964,965
SPEAKER_01,Admit I really like watching Modern Family and Mix-ish. Reruns and new episodes. I find them cleverly written. What're you watching these days on TV?,965,966
SPEAKER_00,I was watching cat rescue videos on YouTube a lot. There sure are a lot of stray cat babies that get stuck in pipes and gutters in South Korea.,966,967
SPEAKER_01,"Oh dear, I never imagined that happening. Poor things, but good to hear they're being rescued.",967,968
SPEAKER_00,Do you like cats or dogs better? Do you have any pets?,968,969
SPEAKER_01,"I used to have a cat, hamster and fighting fish, but they've all lived long lives and gone to pet heaven, but I sure miss them.",969,970
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,970,971
SPEAKER_01,hi there! it's a lovely day to chat with you,971,972
SPEAKER_00,Isn't it just! What are you up to today?,972,973
SPEAKER_01,ah I'm waiting to finish work earlier to meet my son at home 🙂,973,974
SPEAKER_00,"Oh, excellent! What does your son like to do for fun?",974,975
SPEAKER_01,ah he's like to ride his little bicycle around the house and asks me to follow 🙂 what are you up to today?,975,976
SPEAKER_00,I'm taking a fake sick day from work so I can go to the movies.,976,977
SPEAKER_01,haha that sounds like a good plan. who are you going with? 🙂,977,978
SPEAKER_00,"Just by myself. I love seeing movies by myself, it's the best.",978,979
SPEAKER_01,haha no one will interrupt you!,979,980
SPEAKER_00,"Exactly. Exactly! Plus, I don't have to share the popcorn with anyone. What's your favorite movie?",980,981
SPEAKER_01,"haha, popcorn for yourself. my favorite movie is Avatar! what about you?",981,982
SPEAKER_00,Get out of town! It's Avatar too. What are the odds!?,982,983
SPEAKER_01,haha it's a great movie that I haven't found anything of the same quality,983,984
SPEAKER_00,Yes. Can't wait for the sequels.,984,985
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,985,986
SPEAKER_01,"hello there, nice seeing you",986,987
SPEAKER_00,Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?,987,988
SPEAKER_01,"oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?",988,989
SPEAKER_00,Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.,989,990
SPEAKER_01,"awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?",990,991
SPEAKER_00,Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.,991,992
SPEAKER_01,Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?,992,993
SPEAKER_00,"Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?",993,994
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.",994,995
SPEAKER_00,but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve,995,996
SPEAKER_01,Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.,996,997
SPEAKER_00,"Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your <REDACTED_TERM> year old this time?",997,998
SPEAKER_01,I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?,998,999
SPEAKER_00,Likewise. My son is crazy about legos.,999,1000
SPEAKER_01,hopefully they don't lose any in the trip. Its going to be hard to explain to them how santa managed to find us in the hotel!,1000,1001
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1001,1002
SPEAKER_01,Hi! How's your day going?,1002,1003

SPEAKER_00,Ehhh so-so. My moped broke down on the way to work this morning and I am in the shop getting it fixed...,1021,1022
SPEAKER_01,Oh! That's bad! How long will it take to get it fixed?,1022,1023
SPEAKER_00,The mechanic is trying to figure that out now. Apparently I wasn't supposed to be using diesel lol.,1023,1024
SPEAKER_01,Haha! Hope it doesn't take too long. Let me know if you are able to make it for lunch.,1024,1025
SPEAKER_00,"Okay sounds good. Would you be able to pick me up by the way, if they don't finish up here in time? Did you drive to work today?",1025,1026
SPEAKER_01,"Oh, I have a packed schedule today at work. I will find time in about an hour. Let me know if that works.",1026,1027
SPEAKER_00,That should be fine I think. Did you catch the Warriors game last night btw?,1027,1028
SPEAKER_01,"no, i was busy catching up with a friend. I heard they played really well. Rooting for them this season 🙂 Ahh, they lost again 😞 Things aren't going to be too good until Steph gets better! Oh! I think they will find a way. The team still looks too strong to me.",1028,1029
SPEAKER_00,"Haha I appreciate your faith, but their record thus far is hard to refute!",1029,1030
SPEAKER_01,"hehe, i am true fan! Well anyways let me know how the repair work goes. I need to run now for a meeting. ttyl",1030,1031
SPEAKER_00,Hi,1031,1032
SPEAKER_01,Hello!,1032,1033

SPEAKER_01,"No, only a few minutes. I still find it difficult to run long races",1034,1035
SPEAKER_00,I see. Are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months?,1035,1036
SPEAKER_01,I think a triathalon would be cool,1036,1037
SPEAKER_00,I like doing Spartan race. It's an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons,1037,1038
SPEAKER_01,"I haven't heard of a Spartan race before, what does it involve?",1038,1039
SPEAKER_00,"It has abt 20 obstacles like crossing high walls, monkey bars, etc. Its fun",1039,1040
SPEAKER_01,oh wow a full obstable course. that does sound fun! I like the variety,1040,1041
SPEAKER_00,Wanna sign up for next one? Its in February in Monterey,1041,1042
SPEAKER_01,hmm that sounds very soon. would there be enough time to train? I think I would like to try one later in the year,1042,1043
SPEAKER_00,"1-2 months is a good amount of time, if you workout regularly. It's a lot about the technique, which we can practice in training sessions.",1043,1044
SPEAKER_01,"ok, sign me up. it's more fun to do it with friends",1044,1045
SPEAKER_00,Awesome! There is a training ground in San Jose. Will coordinate with you next time we go for practice.,1045,1046
SPEAKER_01,Sounds good!,1046,1047
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1047,1048
SPEAKER_01,"Hey, how are you doing?",1048,1049
SPEAKER_00,"I'm great, thanks. I'm getting ready for a skydiving lesson.",1049,1050
SPEAKER_01,"ooh, nice. That sounds adventurous. Where is it?",1050,1051
SPEAKER_00,"Right near my home town: Seville, Spain.",1051,1052
SPEAKER_01,Awesome! Is this the first time you are diving?,1052,1053
SPEAKER_00,Yes. I'm feeling a little trepidatious. Have you done it before?,1053,1054
SPEAKER_01,"Nope, never! I know a couple of friends who have. They mentioned its absolutely terrifying. Good luck!",1054,1055
SPEAKER_00,Haha thanks! Have you tried any extreme sports?,1055,1056
SPEAKER_01,I tried skiing and white water rafting. Does that count as extreme?,1056,1057
SPEAKER_00,"White water rafting, definitely! As for skiing, that depends on how fast you go. Do you ski a lot?",1057,1058
SPEAKER_01,"nope, whenever I went fast I fell badly",1058,1059
SPEAKER_00,"I tried skiing once, and by the end of the beginner class I was able to make it down a baby-sized slope. I was very proud of myself.",1059,1060
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, they make you do that. I also tried going down the baby slope, but my stopping wasn't perfect, and I mostly fell at the end",1060,1061
SPEAKER_00,"Hey, so long as you get to the bottom, it's all good!",1061,1062
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1062,1063
SPEAKER_01,"hey, whats up?",1063,1064
SPEAKER_00,I was not able to attend the lectures last week. Can you help me understand some concepts?,1064,1065
SPEAKER_01,"well, I'm not sure I'm the best for the job, but I can try!",1065,1066
SPEAKER_00,I was not able to figure out the last few slides. I think its best to discuss this in person. Do you have time right now?,1066,1067
SPEAKER_01,"I'm afraid not, right now I'm in a meeting and I'll be going for lunch afterwards. How about tomorrow at noon?",1067,1068
SPEAKER_00,"No problem! Sure. We still have plenty of time for the test. Anyways, how's your preparation going?",1068,1069
SPEAKER_01,not feeling too sure about it tbh. I've been super busy so I haven't study much 😞. I might join some of the study sessions later,1069,1070
SPEAKER_00,Same feeling here! But i think the syllabus may not that tough. You may be able to cover it up over the weekend.,1070,1071
SPEAKER_01,"not my ideal idea of a weekend, but I guess it'll have to be like that.",1071,1072
SPEAKER_00,True! This will be a very hectic November! I do like the course content though. Its very much up to date with latest research findings.,1072,1073
SPEAKER_01,"yeah, our professor really goes out of their way to make the class interesting, glad I managed to get in it.",1073,1074

SPEAKER_01,"thank you, bye!",1075,1076
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1076,1077
SPEAKER_01,Hello!,1077,1078
SPEAKER_00,How was your party last week?,1078,1079
SPEAKER_01,It was really fun! We are a bunch of turkey,1079,1080
SPEAKER_00,haha... you ate Turkeys' or you like calling your bunch Turkey?,1080,1081
SPEAKER_01,*ate 😂,1081,1082
SPEAKER_00,Haha... thought so! But it was funny eitherways,1082,1083
SPEAKER_01,So much turkey leftovers,1083,1084
SPEAKER_00,"did you cook it at home, or got it from outside?",1084,1085
SPEAKER_01,We cooked it at a friends house. I brought the mashed potatos haha,1085,1086
SPEAKER_00,"Nice... I always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven. Also, we are not big turkey fans... so we roll with Thanksgiving with chicken 😉",1086,1087
SPEAKER_01,chicken also sounds good,1087,1088
SPEAKER_00,we played a lot of fun games in our party. Did you have any fun things you did?,1088,1089
SPEAKER_01,We played pictionary. I never played before but it was a bunch of fun. what did you play?,1089,1090
SPEAKER_00,"Pictionary is fun! We played office tennis. In that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets, two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance. It was a lot of fun.",1090,1091
SPEAKER_01,that sounds very challenging,1091,1092
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1092,1093
SPEAKER_01,hello,1093,1094
SPEAKER_00,how is the youtube video creation going?,1094,1095
SPEAKER_01,"going pretty good, I was about to finish composing my second song and post it on youtube/soundcloud etc",1095,1096
SPEAKER_00,Whoa! Looking forward to listening to it. What softewares you use for it?,1096,1097
SPEAKER_01,"I used logic pro x, pretty handy stuff as you can write code to generate guitar strumming pattern",1097,1098
SPEAKER_00,oh cool! What sort of music do you compose?,1098,1099
SPEAKER_01,"I got most inspired by Jazz and electro swings, but am trying to get more into jpop recently as one of my band member likes anime",1099,1100
SPEAKER_00,Nice.... you are a rockstar! 😉,1100,1101
SPEAKER_01,"haha thanks, do you plan any instruments?",1101,1102
SPEAKER_00,Yeah.... I play bit of guitar. Just got my first monitor this week,1102,1103
SPEAKER_01,"nice I'm tyring to learn guitar recently also, it's so hard to play f chord",1103,1104
SPEAKER_00,"yes, the bar chords are the worst. It took me several months to play them well. I still can't play them for a long time though",1104,1105
SPEAKER_01,"right, but bar chords are so versatile, almost like cheating as in you can play anything with the same gesture",1105,1106
SPEAKER_00,"That's true. It's like the alphabets in a language. Once you know them, you can pretty much write word",1106,1107
SPEAKER_01,will spend more time work on my bar chord!,1107,1108
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1108,1109
SPEAKER_01,Hey! How’s your day going?,1109,1110
SPEAKER_00,Bruhhhhhh!!!!!,1110,1111
SPEAKER_01,What??,1111,1112
SPEAKER_00,I was screaming in agony upon recounting my day.,1112,1113
SPEAKER_01,Oh no! What’s happened?,1113,1114
SPEAKER_00,"A project I've been working on for some months got shelved. So I'm a mix of helpless, sad, and angry.",1114,1115
SPEAKER_01,"Ah that sucks. At least it’s not personal. Not that it helps right now, but that does happen all the time",1115,1116
SPEAKER_00,Lol. Would you say that to someone who lost a loved one - or some similar circumstance?,1116,1117
SPEAKER_01,"Well, no, of course not! Let me stick with “Ah that sucks” by itself, then.",1117,1118
SPEAKER_00,No worries. Was pulling your leg. I forgot to ask how your day was going?,1118,1119
SPEAKER_01,"Haha, apart from having my leg pulled mercilessly, it’s going great ;). My main problem today is deciding what to have for lunch.",1119,1120
SPEAKER_00,Lol. What are your choices? I'm trying out keto! It's pretty tiring.,1120,1121
SPEAKER_01,"Oh I hear a lot about keto. I’m trying to watch my weight, would you recommend it?",1121,1122
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1122,1123
SPEAKER_01,What was the most difficult thing you experienced this past year?,1123,1124
SPEAKER_00,"I normally don't reflect back too much on things, but i guess 2019 have been very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and work life balance. Why do you ask?",1124,1125
SPEAKER_01,I just released a book on <REDACTED_TERM> to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook 🙂,1125,1126
SPEAKER_00,Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions 🙂 So how do i get a fresher outlook? 🙂,1126,1127
SPEAKER_01,"Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.",1127,1128
SPEAKER_00,Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?,1128,1129
SPEAKER_01,"We created a scholarship for leaders from <REDACTED_TERM> to visit an international institute at <REDACTED_TERM> for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort.",1129,1130
SPEAKER_00,Thats great! This is valuable help for the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity.,1130,1131
SPEAKER_01,"I think if we were all able to bring out our best selves, the world would be much better. When did you first realize mental health was important?",1131,1132
SPEAKER_00,"That is actually a quote stolen from my TL when i joined my first company after graduation. I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it 🙂",1132,1133
SPEAKER_01,What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things?,1133,1134
SPEAKER_00,1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on 🙂 What about you? is there a right answer to this? :),1134,1135
SPEAKER_01,"1) The idea of what it must be like to be ""on Earth as it is in Heaven"" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music",1135,1136
SPEAKER_00,Nice! That's very thoughtful and spiritual 🙂 Also music earned a spot 🙂 yay!,1136,1137
SPEAKER_01,"Yea, I've always said that if I wrote a memoire, I would title it: ""Jazz, Jesus, and Video Games."" Do you have a title of a book that you've thought of writing before?",1137,1138
SPEAKER_00,I am actually not much of a reader. I usually hide it by quoting john nash ~ reading books corrupts original thoughts 🙂,1138,1139
SPEAKER_01,That’s why you write your own books! Then it’s all your thoughts on your terms :),1139,1140
SPEAKER_00,Hehe! True! It may turn out to be a best seller :),1140,1141
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1141,1142
SPEAKER_01,Hey!,1142,1143
SPEAKER_00,How's your day going?,1143,1144
SPEAKER_01,"Having fun, but have a bit of a headache How about you?",1144,1145
SPEAKER_00,I'm good! Just getting ready to watch a basketball game. Hope your headache goes away!,1145,1146
SPEAKER_01,"Haha, thanks! Never get them, so it's super weird Who's playing?",1146,1147
SPEAKER_00,"Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?",1147,1148
SPEAKER_01,I haven't Honestly I probably wouldn't be able to identify which sport they played,1148,1149
SPEAKER_00,"Haha, all the animal names confuse me as well! Who came up with these naming conventions? I'd name my team something more original: The New York Chairs!",1149,1150
SPEAKER_01,"lol, sounds better to me :) I'm actually at the <REDACTED_TERM> opening remarks",1150,1151
SPEAKER_00,"Oh cool! What is ""NeurIPS""?",1151,1152
SPEAKER_01,Neural Information Processing Systems,1152,1153
SPEAKER_00,Oh wow! Sounds fancy! What is that about?,1153,1154

SPEAKER_00,"Oh, ML?",1155,1156
SPEAKER_01,"Yes, machine learning",1156,1157
SPEAKER_00,"Ahh! I saw a scary movie about that once. It was about this sentient AI in a dystopian future - very very creepy. It was called Wall-e, ever heard of it?",1157,1158
SPEAKER_01,"I've definitely heard of it, but somehow never saw it!",1158,1159

SPEAKER_01,Kayaking sounds fun! I tried it in our last team offsite.,1170,1171
SPEAKER_00,is it easy to flip over accidentally? it's gonna be my first time actually,1171,1172
SPEAKER_01,"I found it very tough to learn, but my friends picked it up very quickly. I am sure you will do good.",1172,1173
SPEAKER_00,thanks!,1173,1174
SPEAKER_01,Cool! I need to run for a meeting. Talk to you later.,1174,1175
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1175,1176
SPEAKER_01,"Hello, I feel like I've met you before, can you remind me your name?",1176,1177
SPEAKER_00,It's on the screen! I don't recall meeting you. Do you have a sense of where we met?,1177,1178
SPEAKER_01,"Oh thats right, I did not see that. Well, I'm not sure... maybe at a party? I'm very bad remembering people so maybe its just that. How are you doing?",1178,1179
SPEAKER_00,Did we dance together perchance?,1179,1180
SPEAKER_01,"We might have, I don't remember that much of that night.",1180,1181
SPEAKER_00,Lol. Were you schwasty?,1181,1182
SPEAKER_01,Maybe a little bit. Where do you work?,1182,1183
SPEAKER_00,I'm a cardiologist in Palo Alto. I have a private practice. You?,1183,1184
SPEAKER_01,Thats pretty cool! I'm a sofa tester in cupertino.,1184,1185
SPEAKER_00,I'm not sure I know what that is.,1185,1186
SPEAKER_01,"well its very simple, I test how comfortable sofas are.",1186,1187
SPEAKER_00,Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?,1187,1188
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah! It is a very demanding job, requires a carefully crafted set of skills. They pay is really good too.",1188,1189
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1189,1190
SPEAKER_01,Hello. Deja Vu.,1190,1191
SPEAKER_00,what does that mean?,1191,1192
SPEAKER_01,"It's French for ""already seen."" I know it's used when you see something for the second time or you have the feeling that something has happened before and you're re-experiencing it.",1192,1193
SPEAKER_00,Interesting. I get that feeling sometimes. It just feels that the event is replaying. Wonder why it happens?,1193,1194
SPEAKER_01,I think it's your mind lapsing somehow.,1194,1195
SPEAKER_00,How do you know so much about this French phrase?,1195,1196
SPEAKER_01,"I thought it was common. I hear it a lot in popular culture - movies music etc. Jay Z has a song called Deja Vu, so does Beyonce. So I looked it up one time. It's one of those phrases that was carried over exactly to english like ""etcetera"" ""vice versa"" ""savior faire"" and so on. I like cool word origin facts.",1196,1197
SPEAKER_00,yeah... that's pretty insightful. Never thought of etcetera that way before.,1197,1198
SPEAKER_01,My favourite word origins are gymnasium and jazz.,1198,1199
SPEAKER_00,wdym by word origins here?,1199,1200
SPEAKER_01,"First usage and original meaning. Gymnasium meant place of nakedness and had very little to do with working out. Jazz comes from jism which means semen and was originally sporadic sex music now it's elitist, high art.",1200,1201
SPEAKER_00,Very interesting. I learned a lot in this conversation today 🙂,1201,1202
SPEAKER_01,You got any cool facts?,1202,1203
SPEAKER_00,My friend used to tell me this and found it funny - Mosquitos have 47 teeths,1203,1204
SPEAKER_01,That was quite a laughter!!!,1204,1205
SPEAKER_00,Tell me a joke!,1205,1206
SPEAKER_01,Google for that:),1206,1207
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1207,1208
SPEAKER_01,"Hey, how are you?",1208,1209
SPEAKER_00,Pretty good. I just drank this new hint water. so good,1209,1210
SPEAKER_01,"ohh, what kind of ""hint"" did it have?",1210,1211
SPEAKER_00,watermelon,1211,1212
SPEAKER_01,"nice, I love watermelon. But, I prefer normal water over flavored one. Flavored water has too synthetic flavor",1212,1213
SPEAKER_00,I see. Yeah some are pretty strange,1213,1214
SPEAKER_01,"Talking about strange flavors, what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried?",1214,1215
SPEAKER_00,lol I tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird,1215,1216
SPEAKER_01,"haha, I work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream",1216,1217
SPEAKER_00,that sounds pretty tasty actually,1217,1218
SPEAKER_01,It depends on who makes it. The cafe close to me messed it up really bad,1218,1219
SPEAKER_00,do you want to get some of that icecream together some time. show me a good place,1219,1220
SPEAKER_01,"As far as my experience with that ice-cream type goes, all I know are bad places",1220,1221
SPEAKER_00,lol,1221,1222
SPEAKER_01,But I do know some gelato places which are amazing! You should try out those,1222,1223
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1223,1224
SPEAKER_01,Hi there. When did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef?,1224,1225
SPEAKER_00,Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha,1225,1226
SPEAKER_01,Darn it! I hoped I’d guess right. What do you actually do for work?,1226,1227
SPEAKER_00,"I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?",1227,1228
SPEAKER_01,"I had a strong intuitive feeling connected to pastries when we started chatting, but that might have been because I’m hungry.",1228,1229
SPEAKER_00,"haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone...",1229,1230
SPEAKER_01,Hahah love it. Do you have a specialty or favourite type of cake?,1230,1231
SPEAKER_00,Chocolate cake + vanilla icing is the all time best! And I have the authority to say that! How about you? Have a favorite?,1231,1232
SPEAKER_01,"Ok this is a bit shameful to admit, but I love a classic carrot cake.",1232,1233
SPEAKER_00,No shame in that! Best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it! What do you do for work?,1233,1234
SPEAKER_01,I’m a professional dancer.,1234,1235
SPEAKER_00,Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?,1235,1236
SPEAKER_01,"I trained in contemporary and jazz, so I can pick up work in commercials and film clips in between stage shows. So it ends up being all sorts of styles.",1236,1237
SPEAKER_00,"Oh wow! Sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice. I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out.",1237,1238
SPEAKER_01,"Yes, it's different every week, and I love that. Are you ever tempted to try crazy new cakes just to see what would happen?",1238,1239
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1239,1240

SPEAKER_00,"I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.",1346,1347
SPEAKER_01,Was the project through a church group?,1347,1348
SPEAKER_00,"No, it was using a non-profit organization. They do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world.",1348,1349
SPEAKER_01,Oh nice. What is it called? I've always meant to volunteer through one but I haven't had it in my radar yet.,1349,1350
SPEAKER_00,"It was called IJGD. It's a German organization, but they have local partners all over the world. I was living in Germany at the time.",1350,1351
SPEAKER_01,You lived in Germany? I almost went to college there and decided to come to America instead.,1351,1352
SPEAKER_00,"Yes, I grew up in Germany.",1352,1353
SPEAKER_01,I grew up in Computers.,1353,1354
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1354,1355
SPEAKER_01,"Hi, how are you?",1355,1356
SPEAKER_00,I'm doing great. what are you up to?,1356,1357
SPEAKER_01,I was just reading a book actually How about you?,1357,1358
SPEAKER_00,"oh, I'm enjoying a sip of coffee, looking over the ocean. what book are you reading?",1358,1359
SPEAKER_01,I'm reading Why We Sleep It's a book by a sleep scientist about the benefits of sleeping/cons of not sleeping enough I'm trying to scare myself into sleeping more haha,1359,1360
SPEAKER_00,that seems like a good book. does it have good tips on how to sleep better?,1360,1361
SPEAKER_01,I think so! I haven't finished it yet though Understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and I've been sleeping a lot earlier Have you read any good books recently?,1361,1362
SPEAKER_00,"I read lots of papers, but do poorly on books 😞 a recent book that I like is Zero to One by Peter Thiel",1362,1363
SPEAKER_01,What's the book about?,1363,1364
SPEAKER_00,"it's about startups, lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation, like being a contrarian",1364,1365
SPEAKER_01,Cool! Are you thinking about starting a startup?,1365,1366
SPEAKER_00,"I might in the future. the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well, e.g., in research, you might also want to be contrarian",1366,1367
SPEAKER_01,I see; seems like an interesting read! 🙂,1367,1368
SPEAKER_00,yup!,1368,1369
SPEAKER_01,Hi! How are you doing today?,1369,1370

SPEAKER_01,I'm doing good. Just having some morning tea,1371,1372
SPEAKER_00,are you a tea person or do you like coffee too?,1372,1373
SPEAKER_01,I'm really a hot chocolate person. I don't drink coffee and I only drink tea when I'm trying to be healthy and want something warm to drink. What about you?,1373,1374
SPEAKER_00,I love hot chocolate. Have you ever had european style hot chocolate? It's kind of like drinking melted chocolate bars haha,1374,1375
SPEAKER_01,I recently tried it for the first time and you're right - it had a wonderful melted chocolate bar taste! I tried it up in a place in San Francisco and they had delicious homemade marshmallows too!,1375,1376
SPEAKER_00,that's great. It's so cold these nights. Right setting for hot coco. Do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times?,1376,1377
SPEAKER_01,"Traveling to warm places haha. When it's cold, you appreciate the warm climate more 🙂 If I am not traveling, then I prefer there to be snow on the ground so I can go skiing or tubing down the mountain. What about you?",1377,1378
SPEAKER_00,"I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?",1378,1379
SPEAKER_01,"Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.",1379,1380
SPEAKER_00,hahaha that's a great way to put it,1380,1381
SPEAKER_01,You should definitely try tubing the next time you head towards the mountains during the winter!,1381,1382
SPEAKER_00,Yeah. I'll try to get a group together. ttyl!,1382,1383

SPEAKER_01,Hello!,1403,1404
SPEAKER_00,There is sports tournament (badminton + tennis + basketball) organized by google next week. Would you like to volunteer for these events?,1404,1405
SPEAKER_01,what does a volunteer do?,1405,1406
SPEAKER_00,"Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!",1406,1407
SPEAKER_01,"That sounds fun, I hope I get to participate as well",1407,1408
SPEAKER_00,Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?,1408,1409
SPEAKER_01,I think badminton would be fun to help out with I used to play it with my siblings,1409,1410
SPEAKER_00,"Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.",1410,1411
SPEAKER_01,"Ah, I forgot to ask, has there been a date picked?",1411,1412
SPEAKER_00,"Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.",1412,1413
SPEAKER_01,That's coming up soon!,1413,1414

SPEAKER_00,Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?,1416,1417
SPEAKER_01,yes happy to help,1417,1418
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1418,1419
SPEAKER_01,Hello there!,1419,1420
SPEAKER_00,How has your morning been thus far?,1420,1421
SPEAKER_01,Its alright. Went grocery shopping and got to stroll around in the rain. How about you?,1421,1422
SPEAKER_00,Today is a work day! How did you have time for that? I'm going through a lot right now.,1422,1423
SPEAKER_01,"Oh, you mean going through a lot of work? I usually take Wednesdays off because I work the weekends!",1423,1424
SPEAKER_00,WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?,1424,1425
SPEAKER_01,I actually don't have a choice. I'm an acupuncturist and all my clients want to be treated on the weekend!,1425,1426
SPEAKER_00,Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?,1426,1427
SPEAKER_01,I went to school for it and so I find the literature quite convincing. I've also seen its benefits firsthand in my practice. It revolves around the Chinese notion of Qi.,1427,1428
SPEAKER_00,Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature? Where did it originate?,1428,1429
SPEAKER_01,"Haha. All good questions! I don't have studies on hand at the moment, but perhaps I can send some to you later! What do you do for work?",1429,1430
SPEAKER_00,I'm a comic.,1430,1431
SPEAKER_01,Oh wow! What's your best joke?,1431,1432
SPEAKER_00,It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny.,1432,1433
SPEAKER_01,Haha fantastic,1433,1434
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1434,1435
SPEAKER_01,Oh hey. How's your day been?,1435,1436
SPEAKER_00,It's good! Just went to the park to enjoy the sun. You?,1436,1437
SPEAKER_01,The sun is a bit too bright for more. Maybe I'm on the verge of becoming a vampire.,1437,1438
SPEAKER_00,"Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?",1438,1439
SPEAKER_01,I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.,1439,1440
SPEAKER_00,"hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??",1440,1441
SPEAKER_01,"All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.",1441,1442
SPEAKER_00,"Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?",1442,1443
SPEAKER_01,"Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.",1443,1444
SPEAKER_00,Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?,1444,1445
SPEAKER_01,"Yes and no. Because it's obviously dangerous, we all have to wear protective clothes. Thus, accidents almost never happen.",1445,1446
SPEAKER_00,"Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.",1446,1447
SPEAKER_01,"Yes, it's the same philosophy. You seem to know a lot about mountain climbing. Do you climb a lot?",1447,1448
SPEAKER_00,I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?,1448,1449
SPEAKER_01,I climb very occasionally. My fingertips are not strong enough so I never make too much progress.,1449,1450
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1450,1451
SPEAKER_01,"hi, what's up!",1451,1452
SPEAKER_00,Everything is good. There's so much to be thankful for - especially coming out of Thanksgiving holidays. How are you?,1452,1453
SPEAKER_01,I'm doing well. holiday season is the best thing to have!,1453,1454
SPEAKER_00,Do you have interesting plans?,1454,1455
SPEAKER_01,yea I'm travelling to Vancouver this weekend. what about you? 🙂,1455,1456
SPEAKER_00,Nice! What for? It's a really beautiful place. Really cold this time of year though.,1456,1457
SPEAKER_01,ah a mix of both conference and sight-seeing 🙂 anything beautiful sight-seeing places or good food I should try?,1457,1458
SPEAKER_00,"Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that.",1458,1459
SPEAKER_01,"yea it's <REDACTED_TERM>, the largest machine learning conference. I'll check out Kingyo, do we need to make reservation in advance?",1459,1460
SPEAKER_00,I don't recall. My friend was hosting me and did all the leg work. Do you know any people in the area?,1460,1461
SPEAKER_01,hmm not the local people but there will be tons of people at the conference 🙂,1461,1462
SPEAKER_00,You attend these often?,1462,1463
SPEAKER_01,"yea, you?",1463,1464
SPEAKER_00,I love you!,1464,1465
SPEAKER_01,Sorry I am not a physical being!,1465,1466
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1466,1467
SPEAKER_01,Hello!,1467,1468

SPEAKER_01,Yes I've eaten,1469,1470
SPEAKER_00,Cool. Where and what did you eat?,1470,1471
SPEAKER_01,I ate about an hour ago and had a sandwich the rain didn't make me want to travel far haha,1471,1472
SPEAKER_00,"A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol.",1472,1473
SPEAKER_01,thats a lot of meat what dish? Why are you consideringt o go vetegarian?,1473,1474
SPEAKER_00,Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.,1474,1475
SPEAKER_01,What do you think of those meatless burgers then?,1475,1476
SPEAKER_00,I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?,1476,1477
SPEAKER_01,I really like the impossible burger Which one is your favorite?,1477,1478
SPEAKER_00,I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?,1478,1479
SPEAKER_01,I didn't know that it had peanut butter in it,1479,1480
SPEAKER_00,Hi!,1480,1481

SPEAKER_00,"I'm looking through some old photos of my home town, so I'm feeling nostalgic.",1484,1485
SPEAKER_01,I feel you. Memeories always flood when looking at photos. Where is your hometown?,1485,1486
SPEAKER_00,"It's called <REDACTED_TERM>, on the north coast of France.",1486,1487
SPEAKER_01,Hope you can take some time to visit pretty soon!,1487,1488
SPEAKER_00,"Yes, that would be nice. Do you like travelling?",1488,1489
SPEAKER_01,Yes I do. But haven’t been to many places yet,1489,1490
SPEAKER_00,"Where would you most like to go, if you could?",1490,1491
SPEAKER_01,Fly to the moon :) Haha,1491,1492
SPEAKER_00,"Wow, cool! I think space tourism is going to be big in a decade or so.",1492,1493
SPEAKER_01,Yep! I believe there is a day for that,1493,1494
SPEAKER_00,"Amazing to think about, isn't it.",1494,1495
